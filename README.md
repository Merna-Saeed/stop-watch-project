# stop watch project
 Implement the following Stop Watch system with the specifications listed below:
1. Use ATmega16 Microcontroller with frequency 1Mhz.
2. Configure Timer1 in ATmega16 with CTC mode to count the Stop Watch time.
3. Use six Common Anode 7-segments.
4. Connect the six 7-segments in the project using the multiplexed technique. You 
should use one 7447 decoder for all 7-segments and control the enable/disable for 
each 7-segement using a NPN BJT transistor connect to one of the MCU pins. Like the 
below image:
Note: The above image is just to illustrate the basic idea about the multiplexed
7-segments. Use The common anode decoder 7447 instead of the IC in the image.
5. We can connect more than one 7-segment display by using the Multiplexing method. In 
this method, at a time one 7-segment display is driven by the Microcontroller and the rest 
are OFF. It keeps switching the displays using transistors. Due to the persistence of vision, 
it appears as a normal display.
6. Connect 7447 decoder 4-pins to the first 4-pins in PORTC.
7. Use first 6-pins in PORTA as the enable/disable pins for the six 7-segments.
8. Stop Watch counting should start once the power is connected to the MCU.
9. Configure External Interrupt INT0 with falling edge. Connect a push button with the 
internal pull-up resistor. If a falling edge detected the Stop Watch time should be
reset.
10. Configure External Interrupt INT1 with raising edge. Connect a push button with the 
external pull-down resistor. If a raising edge detected the Stop Watch time should be
paused.
11. Configure External Interrupt INT2 with falling edge. Connect a push button with the 
internal pull-up resistor. If a falling edge detected the Stop Watch time should be
resumed.
